First ssh into the control server using "vagrant ssh control"
Get your vagrant insecure private key from "C:\Users\<name>\.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key" and paste it.
This will enable the initial ssh into created nodes (node1, node2, and node3) from the control.
After which you copy the the secure generated ssh (control_id_ed25519.pub) into the nodes.

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
