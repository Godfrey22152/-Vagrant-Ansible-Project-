Ansible Configuration File (ansible.cfg)
#Overview

This README provides an explanation of the configuration options specified in the ansible.cfg file. The ansible.cfg file is used to configure the behavior of Ansible, the automation tool.

Configuration Options
[defaults]
inventory
Description: Specifies the location of the inventory file.
Value: inventory
Explanation: This option sets the location of the inventory file, which defines the hosts that Ansible will manage. In this case, the value is set to inventory, meaning that Ansible will look for the inventory file in the current directory.
private_key_file
Description: Specifies the default SSH private key file used for authentication.
Value: ~/.ssh/ansible
Explanation: This option sets the default SSH private key file that Ansible should use when connecting to managed hosts for authentication. The ~/.ssh/ansible path indicates that Ansible will look for the SSH private key file named ansible in the .ssh directory of the user's home directory.

Usage
To use this configuration file, place it in the directory where you will run Ansible commands. Ensure that you have an inventory file named inventory in the same directory, or adjust the inventory option to point to the location of your inventory file. Additionally, make sure that the SSH private key file specified in the private_key_file option exists and has appropriate permissions.
